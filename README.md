# 31Coders-RTADispatch_SCDFXIBM
Solution for speeding up RTA dispatches

### Description
Our group is made up of three members, Aqil Akram, Raghav Nair, and Sean Manik. Both Aqil and Raghav will be studying Computer Science in NTU and NUS starting this year and Sean will begin his Computer Science course at NUS in 2021. Our group name, 31 Coders, is inspired by the fire station in which we have each served our National Service in. As firefighters in Yishun Fire Station, we witnessed firsthand the challenges faced by emergency responders. We have decided to focus our efforts on helping frontliners respond more quickly and effectively to Road Traffic Accidents.

As we have been taught numerous times, we understand that there is a "golden hour" for victims of car accidents, where survival rates fall off rapidly if we do not get victims to hospitals within an hour from the accident. In addition, there is always a risk of ignition when petrol-based cars are involved in the accident. As such, we hope to close the time gap between the crash and the dispatch of appliances to the incident scene to raise the likelihood of performing successful rescues.

Our solution involves leveraging the advancements in Internet of Things technology to bring about an instantaneous diagnosis of the severity of car crashes. This data will then be rapidly analyzed to generate a list of appliances required to provide an effective response to the situation. Ideally, all appliances required would then be dispatched from the nearest fire station. Through our solution, we are able to save a considerable amount of time from the combination of time spent waiting for a bystander to make a call, time taken for the situation to be explained, and time expended as dispatchers decides on which tiered response is appropriate.
